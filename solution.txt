Script needs to be run before the python file
Script mode needs to be  changed through chmod command. "chmod +x scripting4everone.sh"
script must be run. using commands like "CAT", "NANO" won't work as it will make you more confuse. 
once you run the script you should be able to get the location but it will be encrypted which needs to be decrypted using the Decryption.py file
When you try to decrypt the encrypted string it will ask you for offset_value value which is 4. Participants needs to carefully see the script name to be able to find that value.
Once you enter 4 you shouldbe able to find the location of the casino which is "CrownMelbourneCBD".

Alternatively you can also write the python code which will check the encrypted string against every single offset_value  (bruteforce) to be able to decrypt the text.

Add this code
        # Using for loop to provide offset values range 
        # for offset_value in range(1,95):
        #     decrypted_string = ''

        #     # Using nested loop to convert encrypted string
        #     for ch in encrypted_string:
        #         if ord(ch) - offset_value < 32:
        #             decrypted_string += chr(ord(ch) - offset_value + 95)
        #         else:
        #             decrypted_string += chr(ord(ch) - offset_value)
        #     # Printing decrypted string 
        #     print('Offset:',offset_value,'= Decrypted string:' ,decrypted_string)
